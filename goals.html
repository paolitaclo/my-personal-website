      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>I'm an Industrial Engineer, but since 2 years ago, I got interested in
      coding, so I started to learn a little bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript on
    line, until I decided that it was time to join a more inmersive program.</p>
    <p>
      After a long research I chose Galvanize, I know it is a long and intensive
      program, but I believe I made the right decision. I want to work as a web
      developer and gain the skills to become one. Obviously, after the program,
      my learning phase will keep going and going.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm nervious but excited at the same time. I believe in myself and in what
      I'm capable of.
